# Update `log_panel_features.md` on Product Changes

When changing product behavior or user-visible capabilities in this project, always update `log_panel_features.md` in the same change.

## Must Update For

- New feature added (controls, filters, actions, states, commands).
- Existing behavior changed (UX flow, naming, semantics, shortcuts).
- Feature removed or deprecated.
- Empty-state/error-state behavior changes.

## Update Expectations

- Keep entries concrete and user-facing.
- Reflect current behavior only (no future roadmap items).
- Keep sections accurate and short.
- If a rename happens, update all relevant sections in the file.

## Before Finishing Work

- Verify `log_panel_features.md` reflects all behavior changes in the current diff.
- If no product behavior changed, no update is required.
